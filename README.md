# startlab

Starter code for labs in [SI413](https://roche.work/si413/).

You should not clone this (main) branch of this repo directly.
Instead, clone the specific branch for the current lab, like

    git clone https://github.com/si413usna/startlab -b lab2.3 lab2.3

replacing `lab2.3` with whatever the current lab number is.

(The repetition is intentional. `-b lab2.3` says to get that specific
branch, and the `lab2.3` at the end of the command specifies the name
of the directory to create.)
